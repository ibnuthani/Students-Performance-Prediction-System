# Students Performance Prediction System
A machine learning web application that predicts a student’s performance (Good or Poor) based on personal and academic factors such as attendance, family support, study time, and more.

# Project Overview

This project uses a Random Forest Classifier to analyze student-related data and predict whether a student is likely to perform well (1) or poorly (0).

The goal is to help schools, educators, and parents identify students who may need additional academic support.
